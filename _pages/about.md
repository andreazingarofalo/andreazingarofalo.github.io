Theoretical Physics student University of Salento and School of Advanced Studies ISUFI.

Interests
======
My current interests lie in exploring the foundational and information-theoretic aspects of quantum theory,
particularly in understanding peculiar quantum phenomena such as entanglement and nonlocality, and
their implications for both fundamental physics and emerging technologies.
