PhD Candidate in Quantum Information Theory @ULB

Interests
======
My current interests lie in exploring the foundational and information-theoretic aspects of quantum theory, particularly in understanding peculiar quantum phenomena such as entanglement and nonlocality, and their implications for both fundamental physics and emerging technologies.

I’m also drawn to statistical mechanics, especially where it intersects with quantum foundations and information theory. I enjoy exploring how physical principles constrain the structure of possible theories, and how tools from thermodynamics and probability can shed light on what makes quantum mechanics unique. I’m eager to approach these questions with both conceptual curiosity and mathematical precision.
